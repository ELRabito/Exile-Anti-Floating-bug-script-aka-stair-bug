Hacky solution to "fix" the annoying floating bug. Not the perfect and elegant solution but better than nothig. 

Description: When floating while not falling your character is forced to lay down to avoid death in these situations. 
(Because the games "thinks" you are falling from a deadly height). 

####>>>> Installation

Add the code from the initplayerlocal.sqf file to the end of your initplayerlocal.sqf of your mission-file.
