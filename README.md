Hacky solution to "fix" the annoying floating bug. 
When floating while not falling your character is forced to lay down to avoid death in these situations. 
(Because the games "thinks" you are falling from a deadly height). 

##Installation
Add the code from the initplayerlocal.sqf to the end of your initplayerlocal.sqf of your mission-file.
